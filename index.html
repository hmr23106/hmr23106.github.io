		Nike is the highest grossing fashion company in the world. Nike is a U.S-based atheleisure wear company that specializes in gear for all sports as well as ready-to-wear styles.

		Although many major companies that lead the fashion industry are based in the United States and Europe, the majority of their manufacturing occurs in Asia due to cheap labor and loose labor laws.
		These companies can employ people in manufacturing plants for as little as 6 cents per hour. To those people working they do not expect to be paid anymore, so that makes the companies more money because their payouts are very low.
		The U.S. apparel market is always changing, attempting to adapt to customer trends and new technology that will allow the consumers shopping experience to be more enjoyable and ergonomic."
